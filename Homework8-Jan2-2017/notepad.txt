1)	A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
	For example, it can be used to:
		-->Style an element when a user mouses over it
		-->Style visited and unvisited links differently
		-->Style an element when it gets focus
				
			The syntax of pseudo-classes:

										selector:pseudo-class {
										    property:value;
										}
