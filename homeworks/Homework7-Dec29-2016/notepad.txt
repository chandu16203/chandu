1)	ID selectors:
		You can define style rules based on the id attribute of the elements. All the elements having that id will be formatted according to the 	defined rule.
		The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
		The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
		To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

	Class selectors:
		The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
		To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
		
	Attribute selectors:
		-->You can also apply styles to HTML elements with particular attributes. 
		-->The advantage to this method is that the <input type = "submit" /> element is unaffected, and the color applied only to the desired text fields.
		-->There are following rules applied to attribute selector.
			p[lang] - Selects all paragraph elements with a lang attribute.	
			p[lang="fr"] - Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute has a value of exactly "fr".
			p[lang~="fr"] - Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute contains the word "fr".
			p[lang|="en"] - Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute contains values that are exactly "en", or begin with "en-".	

	tagname selectors:
		--> use it to select multiple elements with same tagName.

5)	descendent selectors:
		Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a particular element.
									syntax:
										selector1 selector2 {
									style properties goes here
											}
			ex:
				<body>
					<div>this is div
						<p>this is para in div
							<span>this is span in para and div</span></p>
						<span>this is span in div</span>
					</div>
				</body>
					in this all the selectors inside the <body> are descendent selectors. means weather the particular selector child seletor or grand child selector, but that particular selector should be inside the main selector. 
6)	child selectors:
		From the above example <div> is the child selector to the <body>
			and <p>,<span>line-30 are the chile selectors to the<div>
				and <span> line-29 is the child selector to the <p>
	selector1 > selector2 { style properties }
		inthis selector1 is the parent selector and selector2 would be the child selector.
7)	The adjacent sibling selector selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element. Sibling elements must have the 		same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
										syntax : 
										selector1+selector2 {
											style properties goes here
										}
		ex:
			<selector1>
				<selector2></selector2>
				<selector3></selector3>
			</selector1>
			in this selector1 and selector2 are the sibiling selectors and both are child selectors to the selector1(parent selector).
8)	[attr]
		Represents an element with an attribute name of attr.
	[attr=value]
		Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is exactly "value".
	[attr~=value]
		Represents an element with an attribute name of attr whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly "value".
	[attr|=value]
		Represents an element with an attribute name of attr. Its value can be exactly “value” or can begin with “value” immediately followed by “-” (U+002D). It can be used for language subcode matches.
	[attr^=value]
		->The [attribute^=value] selector matches every element whose attribute value begins with a specified value.
		-->Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose first value is prefixed by "value".
	[attr$=value]
		-->The [attribute$=value] selector matches every element whose attribute value ends with a specified value.
		----->Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose last value is suffixed by "value".
	[attr*=value]
		/*The [attribute*=value] selector matches every element whose attribute value containing a specified value.*/
		Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value contains at least one occurrence of string "value" as substring.
	

9) it will be explained in index.html multiple selectors with comma.
