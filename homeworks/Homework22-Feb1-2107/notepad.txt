	With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.







4)jQuery is a JavaScript library.
	The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
	jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
	jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

	The jQuery library contains the following features:

	HTML/DOM manipulation
	CSS manipulation
	HTML event methods
	Effects and animations
	AJAX
	Utilities
	Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.

7)Two versions of JQuery.
		Versions of 2.x leave behind the older Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 browsers. 
		In return they are smaller, faster
		The jQuery team still supports the 1.x branch which does run on IE 6/7/8.
		if you’re one of those lucky developers who has dropped support for IE6/7/8, grab jQuery 2.0 and don’t look back.
