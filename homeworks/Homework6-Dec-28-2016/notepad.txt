1)types in css
		CSS Syntax: 
			selector1{
					property name: value;
					property name: value;
					property name: value;
					....
			}
			selector2{
					property name: value;
					property name: value;
					property name: value;
					....
			}
			

		Basicaly there are 3 types in cascading style sheets
			-->Inline style sheets  
								syntax:<tagname style="/*css*/">content</tagname>
									Ex: <a href="" style="text-decoration: none;">content</a>
			
			-->Internal style sheets(Embeded css)
								syntax:
									<style>
										selector1{
													property name: value;
													property name: value;
													property name: value;
														....
												}
										selector2{
												property name: value;
												property name: value;
												property name: value;
												....
										}
									</style>

			-->External style sheets:
					External styles are styles that are written in a separate document (with in the .css files) and then attached to various Web documents.
				    External style sheets can affect any document they are attached to.
							<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
							syntax:
									<style>
										selector1{
													property name: value;
													property name: value;
													property name: value;
														....
												}
										selector2{
												property name: value;
												property name: value;
												property name: value;
												....
										}
									</style>
						to link up those saved .css files we added
							<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
2)"Cascading" means that styles can fall (or cascade) from one style sheet to another, enabling multiple style sheets to be used on one HTML document.

3)CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. 

	CSS Solved a Big Problem
			HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
			HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
			<h1>This is a heading</h1>
			<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
			When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
			To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
			CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
			CSS Saves a Lot of Work!

5)CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more.
		by using this selectors we can add styles to the HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more.
