1)addEventListener():
	The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.
	Tip: Use the removeEventListener() method to remove an event handler that has been attached with the addEventListener() method.
	Tip: Use the document.addEventListener() method to attach an event handler to the document.
				Syntax:
			element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)


3)Id:
	 The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to manipulate the element with the specific id.
	class:
		The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.
	Tag:
		HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag.

5),6)Event Propogation:
 		if you have event listener on both of them
		--> if you have dispacthed event on child(descendent) element. 

		event bubling (from inside out):
		--> child(descendent) event handler is invoked first
		--> parent(ancestor) event hanlder is invoked next
			syntax : 
				.addEventListener(event, handler, captureFlag)

				captureFlag -- false or undefined or parameter not given


		event capturing (from out and the inside):
		--> parent(ancestor) event handler is invoked first
		--> child(descendent) event hanlder is invoked next
			syntax : 
				.addEventListener(event, handler, captureFlag)

				captureFlag -- true
